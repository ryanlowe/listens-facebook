- edit album: can't clear previous listens from 0 to nothing

- use acts_as_indestructible

* time zones are broken
  -- supposed to be relative to user's time zone if not provided, but isn't
  -- http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Fb:time
  -- right now just using America/New_York and Eastern (US and Canada) for server

- queue long-running operations with database+cron?

- remove stylesheet or can move styles to stylesheet now?

- only using one mongrel with port 8001
  -- can have a cluster of mongrels behind apache
     and point Facebook to port 80:
     http://wiki.joyent.com/accelerators:deploying_rails_apps
  -- nginx caching could speed things up a lot

======== older

- move FAQ tab to top? (dashboard tab)

- add News tab beside FAQ, with blog-like thing

*** don't require login to view Listens
  -- if Listens not added:
    -- front: left side should have an add button
    -- front: right side should explain why friends can't been shown
         -- and link to Login to App button to show friends
    -- front: list friends that have added the app already?
    -- albums should be readable using <fb:if-can-see/>
    -- user should be able to see comments
    -- user should be able to comment if they are a friend (requires login to check POST)
    ** update FAQ!

- recommend albums to friends
  -- sends them a notification, with a link to the album

- add albums you want to get and who recommended them
  -- on first listen "move" to albums list
  -- list albums that are queued to be listened to

- news feed items only have first name in other people's news
  -- this is the format for mini feed though! weird...

* consistency: should page titles be prefixed with "Listens - " or not?

* big logo for Application Directory and Application page

* use mocha to ensure feed_publish methods are called correct number of times
  -- right now it only mocks them out to return true

- list My Albums by rating in the right column
    -- also below in rotation on public page? 

- news feed is using UTC to split the listens by day
    -- should it be the profile person's time zone? yes

- after application add or login, go to page that was requested

- let people invite friends
- don't put album in feed if not today? (could put date: "listened to X on December 2nd)
- combine albums in feed as the are listened to on the same day?  "Updated: ..."
* send mail notification when someone makes a comment

- Album optional fields
  - use a flip out like Developer area? (limited javascript in FBML)
  * genre tags
    -- and tag cloud on albums list
    -- general tags too?  label name, etc
    -- instead of tags could be attributes (name=value pairs)

- GLOBAL artists and albums
    -- Facebook-wide and public
    -- cover and tracklist from Amazon
    -- sales referrer URLs from Amazon and iTunes, etc
    -- matched by name to people's albums
    -- comment boards on artist and album pages    
    -- lists which of your friends have the album
    -- overall ratings (imdb-style)

---

- use <fb:if-can-see> instead of requiring login for pages
  - then user doesn't have to "log in"?
  - http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/FeedRankingFAQ
  - display Facebook's 404 and non-permission page if not allowed

- notification preferences like this page:
  -- http://www.facebook.com/editaccount.php?notifications

- use fb_sig_request_method to detect whether original HTTP request
  was a GET or POST

* split profile.setFBML call
  -- http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&story=61

- what is the Facebook "image cache"?

- "previous listen count" isn't obvious enough term?

- format new album and new listen form like Write a Note
  -- labels on top of the text box
  -- with facebook-style form widgets

- make 48x48 icon for twitter, etc ... scale up blocky

- if comment is deleted, delete news feed item
  -- same with listen
  -- keep track of news feed items with a unique id?

- list queue: albums to get and listen to later
  -- including albums recommended by other
  -- once listened, remove from queue
  -- queue is albums with zero listens?  what about past albums?


---

DEPLOYMENT

* move gems to /vendor/gems
- attractive 404 and 500 pages (Facebook-themed)
- Rails: do some page, action and fragment caching
- use a threading library to prevent blocking on Facebook API calls

---

= skip action web service and action mailer?
= print success messages (ie. after album add)
= test facebook_redirect_to uses
= URLs with the artist, album title in them (permalize)


LATER

- add "Share" button to shared album pages
   -- will the album then be visible to the sharer's friends?
      or only to the album creator's friends still?

- on album page, link to your friend's album pages for the same album (text match)
    -- how many friends have this same album?
- can detect user's time zone on submit?
- listen sequence number cached?
- import iTunes XML and parse the albums out of it, removing dupes
- recommend albums to friends (like an invite)
  -- but more like: check out this picture, check out this note
- let people invite friends
  -- on public listens page it says "No listens by this person yet"
     below that have a link to invite them to add Listens




SCOPES

1. private: maintain your own list
2. friends: browse your friend's albums and make comments
       -- you and your friend might have the same album
          and could be commenting on different areas
3. networks: (?) --> local bands?
4. everyone: combine individual's albums somehow, Facebook-wide
       -- spelling is a big issue
       -- a global pool of album data would help with album entry
