= simple_format plugin for Ruby on Rails

  simple_format is a Rails plugin that formats and escapes database
  text for use in HTML views. The result looks a lot like text in
  Gmail: line breaks are converted and links are linked. It will not
  support tags like BBCode, it just formats plain text.

== Installation

  ./script/plugin install http://simple-format.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/simple_format/

== Usage

  SimpleFormat.format(@model.attribute)
  
  Note: HTML angle brackets are escaped by format() so
  you do not need to use h() as well.
