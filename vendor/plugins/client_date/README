= client_date plugin for Ruby on Rails

The client_date Ruby on Rails plugin uses client-side Javascript
to format a date/time in a view instead of the server. The client
is given UTC time for formatting so the server doesn't have to
store which time zone each user is in.

== Installation

  ./script/plugin install http://client-date.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/client_date/

== Usage

First include the ClientDate mixin in your ApplicationHelper.

  module ApplicationHelper
    include ClientDate
    ...
  end

Then copy the javascript code in javascripts/client_date.js to
your project.  You can do this two ways:

  1. Copy client_date.js to your javascripts/ directory and
     add it to your Rails project using javascript_include_tag.
  2. Copy the code in client_date.js to javascripts/application.js
     which is pulled in by javascript_include_tag :defaults.
     
The second option is probably best.  Developers usually try to 
minimize the number of static files their site uses in production.
