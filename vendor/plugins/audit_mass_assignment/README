= audit_mass_assignment plugin for Ruby on Rails

The audit_mass_assignment Ruby on Rails plugin contains a rake task that
checks the models in your project for the attr_accessible whitelist approach
for protecting against "mass assignment" exploits.  It does not check for
use of attr_protected!

If a Rails model does not use attr_accessible, it fails this audit.  The
audit does not check which parameters are accessible or protected, only
that at least one is marked as accessible.

Run the audit whenever you feel like it.  Other audit plugins for Rails
could be created to automatically check for bad patterns or insecure
code.  This one was relatively easy to implement.

== Installation

  ./script/plugin install http://audit-mass-assignment.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/audit_mass_assignment/

== Usage

  $ rake audit:mass_assignment

== NOTES

  If you want to protect ALL attributes use:
  
    attr_accessible nil
